# Build a Multi Capability Alexa Skill (Node.js)

This is an Alexa skill sample that shows how to handle custom and smart home requests in a single skill that supports both models. It shows the discovery and request/response handling of a skill implementing Alexa custom and smart home capabilities.

At the end of this sample, you will have an Alexa skill and a supporting AWS backend that responds to commands for both custom and smart home interaction models. You will implement a "Beeper" skill and a virtual "Beeper" device that allows you to send commands to your computer that instructs your computer to beep.

To start this sample, follow the [instructions](./instructions/README.md).
